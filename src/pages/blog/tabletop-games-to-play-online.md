Here's a list of games you can play with your family or friends online via a group call.

### Free games using a browser

- [Codenames](https://codenames.game/) : A fun word game for 4+ players.

- [One night ultimate werewolf](https://netgames.io/games/onu-werewolf/): A party game for large group of people with hidden roles.
- [Spyfall](https://www.spyfall.app/) : Another party game with a hidden role.

### Tabletop simulator games
Tabletop simulator is a physics sandbox where you can play thousands of community created mods. It often is available for $10 during steam sales. You can buy the simulator and play the mods for free. Here's a list of some of my favorite community mods :

- [Sequence](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849115029&searchtext=sequence) : Great for 2-6 players. Good intro game for tabletop simulator because you learn the controls of shuffling cards, placing tokens, zooming & panning the camera, and finally flipping the table in rage.
- [Skull](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370123188): Easy to play bluffing game for 4+ players.
- [Love letter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=412185866): Quick to play card guessing game.
- [Marvel Infinity Gauntlet](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202666213): It is a themed version of Love letter. In my opinion, better than love letter because it is asymmetrical (Thanos vs heroes).
- [Sheriff of Nottingham](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=598154455): My favorite bluffing game! Best at 4 players.
- [Flamme Rouge](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2146266002):  Tactical bicycle racing game.
- [Biblios](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1119442805): Current favorite game! It involves a good deal of strategy, a little luck, and some bluffing. Best at 3 to 4 players.
- [Dixit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2177479474): Storytelling with targeted clues. Good party game for 5 to 6 players.
- [Carcassonne](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=263788054): Best entry level tile-placement game. 
- [Concept](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=935838925): Word guessing game using icons.
