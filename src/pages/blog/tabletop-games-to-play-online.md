Here's a list of games you can play with your family or friends online via a group call.

### Free games using a browser

- [Codenames](https://codenames.game/) : A fun word game for 4+ players.
- [Skribble.io](https://skribbl.io/) : Drawing and guessing game.
- [Spyfall](https://www.spyfall.app/) : A party game for large group of people with a hidden role.

### Playingcards.io games
You can easily import a pcio file into [playingcards.io](https://www.playingcards.io) and play a card game remotely.

- [6 nimmit!](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/272690/games-implemented-playingcardsio?itemid=8665647) : Choose sequential cards for rows simultaneously, but avoid adding the 6th card! Party game for 5-6 people.
- [Schadenfreude](https://github.com/shreeshbhat/schadenfreude) : Taking tricks, but watch what is played - avoid the values already collected. Trick taking game with interesting twists for 3-5 people.
- [Somnia](https://github.com/shreeshbhat/Somnia-3p) : Trick-taker for 3 about collecting dreams and escaping nightmares.
- [Dokitto Ice](https://github.com/shreeshbhat/Dokitto-Ice) : A trick-taking game in which high values but also low values are strong. You are a member of a famous group of really big eaters (called oogui in Japan). This time, to show your skills, you decide to pay a visit to a famous Ice cream shop. The first bite is incredible! Your taste buds are going crazy! Your friends and you just want to have more, more, more BUT the shop owner has one rule: never order more than 3 scoops of ice cream or your order is cancelled!
- [Mismatch](https://github.com/shreeshbhat/mismatch) : Card game for 4 where the object is to avoid making combinations.
- [12 Chip trick](https://github.com/shreeshbhat/12-chip-trick) : Trick taker for 3. With just 12 cards-- err, chips, try to win the most points. Well, maybe just 20
- [Collusion](https://github.com/shreeshbhat/collusion) : Trick taker for 4 where players try to win the same numbers of tricks. The key twist is that table talk is encouraged.
- [nana](https://github.com/shreeshbhat/nana) : Set collection game for 3-5 players, where can you find another card with that number? My hand? Their hand? Which end? 

I highly recommend going through this huge list of 400+ games to find what you like. [List of games](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/272690/games-implemented-playingcardsio).
